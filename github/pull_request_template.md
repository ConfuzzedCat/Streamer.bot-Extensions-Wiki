[] Included all images in documentation.
[] Used relative pathing i.e. (/extensions/your extension/images/image.png).
[] Included import file.
[] Made sure that all variables were camelCase (Non-camelCase variables won't work so won't be approved).
[] Detailed explanation of how your extension works (We test all of these so if we can't figure out how to use it the extension won't be approved).

Make sure to put an x in each check list item and that the items checked off have been completed.
Any extensions submitted with the checklist done and found not to be adhered to will be closed without warning.
