<p>Download the files needed by clicking the link above and extract the folder to where you save your files used in your stream</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Add a browser source to OBS and tick the “Local File” box and then browse to the folder you just extracted. Point to the index.html file.</p>
<h2>Editing/Styling</h2>
<p>The credits are styled using the included CSS and JS files. While some of the more advanced changes will take a basic understanding of web development changing the two colors and (to a certain degree) the fonts are not complicated things to do. You will need a text editor. If you are working with an unaltered style.css you fill find the following sections on the listed line of the editor:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Font Class Import (Google Font) ---- Line 1</li>
  <li>Font Name and Size ------------------- Line 21</li>
  <li>RGB Color Code For Names Listed – Line 24</li>
  <li>RGB Color Code for Titles/Sections – Line 37</li>
</ul>

<h2>Video Notes/Updates</h2>
<p>Since the release of this video some things have been added to the JS page, allowing for adding text and/or image URLs to the start and/or end of the credits as they scroll. You will find where to add them in the script.js file, lines 71-79.</p>
