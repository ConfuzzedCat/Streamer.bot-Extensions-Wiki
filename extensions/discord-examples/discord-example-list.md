Using the following Examples you will be able to post to discord in many different ways. 

The first thing you will need to do is to get a Webhook.

Go to your Discord Server `Settings > Integrations` and click new `Web Hook`.

Choose a channel for it to post to and give it a name, anything will do.

Copy the Webhook URL - you will need this for the c# code later so save it somewhere for now.
