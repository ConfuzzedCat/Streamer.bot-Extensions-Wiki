# Free For Alls [(by TerrierDarts)](https://www.twitch.tv/terrierdarts)
## Description
Free-For-Alls (FFA) is a chat point extension that will allow you to run a game, in which all users stake a certain amount of point and the last user standing will take the whole pot. For example if 10 people enter staking 1000 points then the winner will take 10000 points.
## Tutorial

## Import Code
```
CodeHere
```

## Set Up
Once you've imported the code you will recieve 3 actions, you will need to set up 2 triggers one to start the FFA and one which will allow people to join the FFA. The start can be triggered however you want. Usually a chat command is best for the join, however what you choose that command to be is upto you. Once you've set them 2 triggers up it's now time to check that the code compiles.

Once the code is all compiled it now time to look at the customisable settings.
