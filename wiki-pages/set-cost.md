## Reward
The reward you want to edit.

## Cost

The amount you wish to edit with.

## Operator
This is how you want to effect the reward, this can be `None`, `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply` or `Divide`. Selecting `None` will just set the reward to the amount stated in cost.

## Reset to Original

This will automatically set `Cost` to the original cost and `Operator` to none.
